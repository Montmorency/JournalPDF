Script for getting pdflink out of science direct web page.
Can be extended for different journals if anyone interested...

Usage:
  python get_pdf.py -u www.sciencedirect.com/article

Potentially I will add other journals as the case arises. Right now
only necessary when I don't want to use an ssh window to forward
the page.
